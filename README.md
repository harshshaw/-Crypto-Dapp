## ❓ Problem Statement
> Entrepreneurs face lot of dilemma before starting a startup or raising fund for their projects. As we all know that starting a venture is not an easy task, there are lot of challenges associated with it. To help our entrepreneur to overcome this dilemma we have designed this platform. We have especially introduced a Web3.0 Fund raising Defi App for the Entrepreneurs/Developers for raising fund for their software/hardware projects for Farmers and Agriculture.

## 🤔 Challenges we faced
- Configuring and connecting of local blockchain
- Debugging code
- Writing efficient and good quality smart contract without bugs
- Compiling smart contracts with proper syntax to reduce the gas fees
- Creating erc20 Token contract
- Writing proper test for the smart contracts

## 💡 Features
- We issued our own ERC20 standard token known as Cb token
- Investor can buy our erc20 token (Cb token) in exchange with ethereum
- Developer can create a project for fund raising in our platform
- Developer can set a goal of fund they want to raise for their software/hardware projects
- Investor can donate to the project with our Cb token
- All the investor who help to complete the project goal amount for raising will receive Cb token as reward
